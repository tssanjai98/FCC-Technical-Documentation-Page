          <span class="important">JavaScript (JS)</span> is a lightweight,
          interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
          first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting
          language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it,
          such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
          prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language,
          supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g.
          functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification
          (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification
          (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on
          the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where
          some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been
          implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles
          may use some of those new features.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it
          has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For
          example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used
          as a variable name.
        </p>
        <code
          ><span class="keyword">let</span> Früh =
          <span class="string">"foobar"</span></code
        >
        <p>
          But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is
          case sensitive. In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and
          are separated by semicolons (;). A semicolon is not necessary after a
          statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one
          statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by
          semicolons.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          <span class="bold">Note:</span> ECMAScript also has rules for
          automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more
          information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical
          grammar.)
        </p>
        <p>
          It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon
          after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice
          reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code. The source text of
          JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted
          into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control
          characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs,
          and newline characters are considered whitespace.)

      <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
        <header>Hello World</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in
          multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>
        <code>
          (<span class="keyword">function</span>(){<br />
          <span class="string">"use strict"</span>;<br />
          /* Start of your code */<br />
          <span class="keywork">function</span>
          <span class="function">greetMe</span>(yourName) {<br />
          <span class="function">alert</span>(<span class="string"
            >'Hello '</span
          >
          + yourName); <br />}<br />

          <span class="function">greetMe</span>(<span class="string"
            >'World'</span
          >);<br />
          /* End of your code */<br />
          })();
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).
          You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use
          the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some
          examples of legal names are
          <span class="important">Number_hits</span>,
          <span class="important">temp99</span>,
          <span class="important">$credit</span>, and
          <span class="important">_name</span>. You can declare a variable in
          two ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              With the keyword var. For example,
              <span class="important">var x = 42</span>. This syntax can be used
              to declare both local and global variables, depending on the
              execution context.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              With the keyword const or let. For example,
              <span class="important">let y = 13</span>. This syntax can be used
              to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope
              below.)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as any variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign
          ($), and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code
          ><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="string">PI</span> =
          <span class="string">3.14</span>;</code
        >
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value. The
          scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope
          variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed
          to represent a variable. You cannot declare a constant with the same
          name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR <br />
          <span class="keyword">function</span>
          <span class="function">f</span>() {};<br />
          <span class="keyword">const</span> f = <span class="string">5;</span>
          <br /><br />
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR TOO <br />
          <span class="keyword">function</span>
          <span class="function">f</span>() { <br />
          <span class="keyword">const</span> g = <span class="string">5</span>
          <br />
          <span class="keyword">var</span> g; <br />
          //statements<br />
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not
          protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="keyword">const</span>
          <span class="string">MY_OBJECT</span> = {<span class="function"
            >'key'</span
          >
          : <span class="string">'value'</span>};<br />
          <span class="string">MY_OBJECT</span>.key =
          <span class="string">'otherValue'</span>;
        </code>
        <p>
          Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="keyword">const</span>
          <span class="string">MY_ARRAY</span> = [<span class="string"
            >'HTML'</span
          >
          , <span class="string">'CSS'</span>];<br />
          <span class="string">MY_ARRAY</span>.<span class="function">push</span
          >(<span class="string">'JAVASCRIPT'</span>);<br />
          console.<span class="function">log</span>(<span class="string"
            >MY_ARRAY</span
          >); //logs ['HTML','CSS','JAVASCRIPT'];

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Seven data types that are primitives:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Boolean</span>.
                  <span class="important">true</span> and
                  <span class="important">false</span>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">null</span>. A special keyword denoting a
                  <span class="important">null</span> value. (Because JavaScript
                  is case-sensitive, null is not the same as
                  <span class="important">Null</span>,
                  <span class="important">NULL</span>, or any other variant.)

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">undefined</span>. A top-level property
                  whose value is not defined.

              </li>

                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Number</span>. An integer or floating point
                  number. For example: <span class="important">42</span> or
                  <span class="important">3.14159</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="bold">BigInt</span>. An integer with arbitrary

                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="bold">String</span>. A sequence of characters
                  that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="bold">Symbol</span> (new in ECMAScript 2015). A
                  data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

            <p>and Object</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to
          perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
          are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
          objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures
          that your script can perform.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A
          function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements
          that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to
          qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output
          where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the
          output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope
          from which you wish to call it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The name of the function.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, <span class="important">{...}</span>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named
          square:
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="keyword">function</span>
          <span class="function">square</span>(number) {<br />
          <span class="keyword">return</span> number * number;<br />
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The statement return
          specifies the value returned by the function:
        </p>
        <code> <span class="keyword">return</span> number * number; </code>
